# Armbian contributor list

The [armbian](https://github.com/armbian/build) directly calls the official source code for compilation, When making dedicated Armbian systems for different boxes, the kernel, scripts, u-boot and other resources made by [flippy](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit) for `Amlogic s9xxx openwrt` are used. The development idea of the program comes from the tutorials of authors such as [ebkso](https://www.kflyo.com/howto-compile-armbian-for-n1-box). Thank you for your dedication and sharing, so that we can use the Armbian system in the Amlogic s9xxx box.

Because of these innovations and contributors, we can have the company of the box in the long river of years. We have grown up many years later, but this beautiful memory will always stay deep in the memory for a long time. From now on, record the achievements of these pioneers and leave them to the new friends who have joined the box circle.
